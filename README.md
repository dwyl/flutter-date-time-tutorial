# Why? ü§∑‚Äç

Because our [`app`](https://github.com/dwyl/app)
will rely heavily on setting dates and times
to track the time spent on each todo item,
we ought to go over the available options
that are available to us in `Flutter`-land.

# What? üí≠

Setting *date* and *time* in `Flutter` apps
can be done in a variety of ways.
There are [several packages/components](https://fluttergems.dev/date-time-picker/)
that serve this purpose,
on top of the official Material widgets.

This repo will showcase a general introduction
to using the official [`DatePicker`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showDatePicker.html) 
and [`TimerPicker`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/showTimePicker.html).


# Who? üë§

This quick demo is aimed at people in the @dwyl team
or anyone who is interested in learning 
more about setting date and time values
in their `Flutter` applications.

# _How_? üë©‚Äçüíª

## Prerequisites? üìù

This demo assumes you have foundational knowledge of `Flutter`.
If this is your first time tinkering with `Flutter`,
we suggest you first take a look at 
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter.

In the linked repo, you will learn 
how to install the needed dependencies
and how to debug your app on both an emulator
or a physical device.


## 0. Project setup

To create a new project in `Flutter`,
follow the steps in 
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-flutter#0-setting-up-a-new-project.

After completing these steps,
you should have a boilerplate `Flutter` project.

If you run the app, you should see the template Counter app.
The tests should also run correctly.
Executing `flutter test --coverage` should yield
this output on the terminal.

```sh
00:02 +1: All tests passed!   
```

This means everything is correctly setup!
We are ready to start implementing!


## 1. Setting up both pages

Before adding our date and time pickers,
we are going to add two different pages:

- the first page will showcase the implementation 
of the official `DatePicker` and `TimePicker`,
the official Material widgets that are commonly used in `Flutter` apps.
- the second page will pertain to **inline pickers**,
meaning there won't be any dialogue/modals showing up 
and hijacking the screen
whenever a person wishes to change date/time.

> **Note:**
>
> If you want to know *why* we're wanting to
> **not** use modals,
> visit https://github.com/dwyl/product-ux-research/issues/38 for more context.

With this in mind,
let's set up a [`BottomNavigationBar`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html)
to toggle between these two scenarios.
In `lib/main.dart`,
change it to:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(const App());

/// App class
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  const App({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const MaterialApp(
      home: HomePage(),
    );
  }
}

/// HomePage with BottomBarNavigation
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  State<HomePage> createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
  int _selectedIndex = 0;

  /// List of pages
  final List<Widget> _pages = <Widget>[
    const Text(
      'Material widget',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    ),
    const Text(
      'Inline widget',
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 30, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
    )
  ];

  /// Callback function that changes the index to show the selected page
  void _onItemTapped(int index) {
    setState(() {
      _selectedIndex = index;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Flutter Date Time Pickers'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: _pages.elementAt(_selectedIndex),
      ),
      bottomNavigationBar: BottomNavigationBar(
        items: const <BottomNavigationBarItem>[
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.adjust),
            label: 'Material',
          ),
          BottomNavigationBarItem(
            icon: Icon(Icons.border_color),
            label: 'Inline',
          ),
        ],
        currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
        selectedItemColor: Colors.amber[800],
        onTap: _onItemTapped,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Whenever the person taps on either `BottomNavigationBar` item,
they change the index of the page being shown
(this is handled by `_onItemTapped`).
If you run the app,
you should see this in action.

Awesome!
Now we're ready to rock üé∏!
